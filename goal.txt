showing:
 List of songs (paginated) with thumb nail and play/pause buttond
 Each row should have 2 options which are to like a song and to comment a song
 Each request should return success or failure status

Thumbnail | Play/Pause | Name of the song/ Name of the singer [ time ] [ like ] 


research ui for these things..
like button has to have a number showing how many likes there are...

if you click on the comment button, it will open a comment dialog that you will be able to
write your comment.

If you click on the tweet, it will take you to the tweet and the list of response
showing the "thread..."
